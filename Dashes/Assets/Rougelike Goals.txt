To do:
Make a key to the boss room
Make the walls higher, so that there is no black frames around the room! :)
Make a max on amount of combo points. This allows for the feeling of being fully charged and seeing the bar is fully filled.
- Additionally it allows for upgrading the total amount of combo points.

Done:
Make a boss UI pop up when entering boss room

Goals:
Large enemy varirity
Interesting level varirities (hidden rooms and such)
Make weapon fun!
class consistency to some extend (know atleast what kit we start with)

Checked:
combat orientated
